In my analysis project I decided to look at the "Local and General" section of the Egyptian Gazette newspaper.
I was interested in the topics that showed up most in the section and moreover what topics kept getting printed
in the issues of the newspaper. As a result of this I decided to create a wordcloud to make a visual
representation of the headlines of each section of the newspaper. In the wordcloud, the headlines that were printed
most are the largest in the figure and then following that are the headlines that are posted less which are represented
by the smaller words in the figure.
Data-
For this data set I created a query that would find only the headlines in the section of local and general and
it would also include the date of the issue posted. I used two queries to do this because the @feature and @element
tags were implemented and each contained data that I needed to combine to get accurate results. The first query used was
as presented //div[@feature="local"]/div/head , the second query is different by one word //div[@element="local"]/div/head .
The first query search returned 2,497 items while the second query resulted in 308 items. After this I transferred all the
results into atom and refined the visual content that the search gave me. At the end I had two columns of data that
was the date of the issue and the headline that was posted on that date in the "Local and General" section of the newspaper.
Conclusion
The largest printed headline was the word "Canal" and the second most printed headline was "Suez". There were other headlines
printed that were seen quite often throughout consisting of: Alexandira, Plague, Egyptian, Stray Dogs, etc. There were often
topics that were repeated in this section of the newspaper and new information was displayed this way in the Egyptian Gazette.

This is a clip of the newspaper that I would find the "Local and General" section in and it is typically found on the third page
of the issue.
