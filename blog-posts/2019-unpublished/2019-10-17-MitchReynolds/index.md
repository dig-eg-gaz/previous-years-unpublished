Similar to society of today, the people of Egypt in the early 20th century took great interest in sporting events. While sports like cricket or horse racing may have been more popular among Egyptian Gazette readers, football (or soccer) has remained a staple in the lives of Egypt’s sports fans. The sport of soccer was in the midst of a cultural boom at this time and it rapidly grew in popularity following the introduction of it as an Olympic event in 1900. The sport first gained popularity in Great Britain and the interest in it was brought to Egypt by the British people who were living there. The newspaper, which was written for British people in Egypt, gave updates on anticipated games and the details of different tournaments. At the time of the newspaper, the majority of the teams competing were British, with Egyptian teams not appearing until the late 1910’s. Specific teams are often mentioned in these sections, such as the St. Andrew F.C. Saints who are mentioned in a sixth of the total sports sections containing football. One section from December 19th, 1905 details a game between St Andrew and ASC where a St Andrew defender attacked an opposing player, causing referees to end the game prematurely. Stories like this one are fun reminders that despite over 100 years between then and now, athletes still tended to have short tempers which resulted in foolish outbursts like this. The photo below shows the Al Ahly Football Club, which was founded in 1907.

Today, the Al Ahly FC is the best club in the Egyptian Premier League and, like the sport itself, has exploded in popularity since the early 1900’s.
