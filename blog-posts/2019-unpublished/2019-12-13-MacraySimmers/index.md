Mr. Isaac Brown has lived for 118 years. He lived in Texas, near Waco for most of his life but then moved in with his son-in-law when he got too old. However, there is no such thing as too old to this man as he reshod a horse at the age of ninety-nine. He is also a veteran of four wars, was born before the founding of the United States, and has seen twenty-two presidents elected. Mr. Brown claims to have always been a rather healthy man, as seen by his incredible feats and his great age, but he attributes his age to a remedy prescribed by his doctor. This remedy is known as Peruna. Before the doctor prescribed Mr. Brown this miracle medicine, the man had to deal with the problems associated with changes in temperature associated with the variable American seasons. Another thing that Isaac Brown had to deal with before his miracle medicine was prescribed was the Grip, otherwise known as Bornholn disease. Dealing with this involves fevers and muscle pain [example](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/bornholm-disease), which could be much troubling for a man of Mr. Brown's age. Peruna was sold between the 19th and 20th century by the Peruna Company. It made claims about all the health benefits it would offer and sometimes it worked, as seen in the example of Mr. Brown. However, in the early 20th century, patent medicine as a whole was brought down with the article "The Great American Fraud", which exposed all the falsehoods of patent medicine. Even through all of this, Mr. Isaac Brown lived to be 118 years old because of this medicine, according to him.
