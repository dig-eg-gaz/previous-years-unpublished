Golf in today’s day in age has come a long way since it was invented in the 19th century. The technology, how it is played, taught and how it is treated at country clubs. There were country clubs that had golf courses in the beginning of the 20th century around the word but the clubs didn’t usually revolve around the golf courses rather than the typical “sporting” club games such as croquet and other games played on nice grass surfaces. Golf has come a long way but it still was more popular in Egypt than most would assume in the beginning of the 20th century. The picture below was one of the first images that showed the initial relevance to golf in Egypt, it was taken at the Mena Club in Egypt and adds a bit of relevance to when golf started up in Egypt when this picture was posted in a golf magazine in 1898. Golf was introduced to Egypt by the English and Scottish since they were the innovators of golf. It was taught and introduced at the end of the 19th century and has flourished ever since.
