On February’s 11th, 1907, Monday’s issue of the Egyptian Gazette was released. In this issue of the newspaper, on the third page, under the column labeled “Local and General,” there was an article referring to a recent tragedy that had occurred near Damanhou that was sent in by Dr. Dauanbour Correspondent. The article was published in the newspaper above the Military Tailors advertisement. The article summarized the murder of thegent of Boghos Pasha Nubar. Major stated that “the victim was sitting in his house surrounded by his family at the time of his death and was actually playing with his youngest, whom he was dandling on his knee. Suddenly the repeat of firearms was heard, and he received two bullets in his head. The murderers demped” commented how a friend of theirs dog suffered from a disease “contracted in the black hole of Boulac.” Not being able to imagine what the family is going through, but the article had me questioning the motives of the murderers. Was it a random act or could thegent of Boghos Pasha Nubar possibly be a criminal himself who dug himself into a hole? The only other details the article released is that the murderers will be going to trial on the following Monday, but what evidence is the court going to convict them on other than the word of witnesses? How did  they even find the murderers to bring them to court? With the technology of 1907 compared to now I cannot imagine the police and government having nearly the same equipment to find little details or fingerprints of possible suspects.

After undertaking further searches about murders, there were only a few articles that came up about the varieties of cases. While there are very few other blog posts about different murders, I didn’t come across any others that gave as much detail as the one I came across in my issue, the others were extremely simple and to the point.
