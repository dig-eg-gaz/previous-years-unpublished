My issue of the Egyptian Gazette, 1907-07-08, didn't seem to have any noticeable curiousities in it, however there was one sort of odd telegraph article about the destruction of a famous picture called "Le Deluge." The article's title, "FAMOUS PICTURE DESTROYED," was simple and essentially summarized the incident. The article was very brief, only a sentence long. Apparently a French man who was out of work tore down "Le Deluge" in the French art museum called "the Louvre." The museum was part of a large palace in 12th century, serving as a fortress for Philip Augustus, the King of France from 1180 to 1223. The Louvre Museum is the most-visited art museum in the world and boasts a collection of artwork dating back to ancient times all the way through the 19th century. It seems the security in the Louvre Museum was not very secure, as just 3 years later the famous Mona Lisa was stolen in potentially the most high profile art heist in history. The out of work Frenchman tore down the painting in a seemingly successful attempt to get himself arrested, likely to get off the streets. The famous painting was one of the four paintings featured in the Nicolas Poussin's "The Seasons," and was inspired by the season of Winter. Nicolas Poussin was an Italian painter who lived during the 17th century, and the somber painting is fittingly called "Le Deluge" which translate to "the flood," with gloomy weather in the sky mimicking the tone of winter. I digress, the the painting is not the curious part about this article, it's just interesting that a man tore a painting down simply to get arrested.
